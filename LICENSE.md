# NIST Technical Series Publications

In accordance with [Public Law 100-519, Section 107 (Oct 24, 1988)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-102/pdf/STATUTE-102-Pg2589.pdf), NIST maintains a research information center to support the research, publishing, and preservation needs required to fulfill the scientific and technical mission of NIST.  This includes publishing the NIST Technical Series: technical reports and Journal of Research of NIST.  All works authored by NIST employees are not subject to Copyright protection within the United States; foreign rights are reserved.  To the extent NIST may assert rights outside of the United States, the public is granted the non-exclusive, perpetual, paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide right to reprint works in all formats including print, electronically, and online, and in all subsequent editions, and derivative works.  Please use the recommended citation format below followed by “Republished courtesy of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.”  Some works published by NIST may have been written by third parties and may be subject to copyright protection.

## Citation Recommendations

Journals often have their own citing formats for publications and other items included in article reference lists. NIST's data and software citation recommendations are consistent in using the same citation elements (author, title, publisher, year of publication, etc.) as used by journals. In the absence of other (e.g., journal) defined requirements, these recommendations provide a consistent manner for appropriate attribution to scientific datasets and software that are made available under NIST's public access policy.
