# Digital Identity Guidelines: Implementation Resources

[NIST Special Publication 800-63-3](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html), *Digital Identity Guidelines*, is an umbrella publication that introduces the digital identity model described in the SP 800-63-3 document suite. It frames identity guidelines in three major areas:

* Enrollment and identity proofing ([SP 800-63A](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html))
* Authentication and lifecycle management ([SP 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html))
* Federation and assertions ([SP 800-63C](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html))

In addition to introducing the detailed guidelines in these areas, SP 800-63-3 addresses the factors involved in choosing the appropriate Identity Assurance Level (IAL), Authentication Assurance Level (AAL), and Federation Assurance Level (FAL) for a given application.

These implementation resources are provided pursuant to OMB memorandum [M-19-17](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/M-19-17.pdf). While these resources reference normative guidelines in the SP 800-63-3 document suite and other documents, these resources are intended as informative implementation guidance and are not normative. 
These implementation resources provide guidance for SP 800-63-3 in three parts: Part A addresses SP 800-63A, Part B addresses SP 800-63B, and Part C addresses SP 800-63C. Section numbers are presented in parentheses in each part which refer to the SP 800-63-3 volume corresponding to that part. 

Comments on these guidelines are welcomed and can be submitted via email to <dig-comments@nist.gov>.
