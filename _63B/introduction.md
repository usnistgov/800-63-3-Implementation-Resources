# B.1 Introduction {#s-b-1}

The publication of NIST [Special Publication 800-63B](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b), *Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management* significantly updated authentication guidelines in previous editions of SP 800-63. These implementation resources provide additional non-normative information to agencies and others for the implementiation and deployment of authenticated systems adhering to the SP 800-63B guidelines. These resources are intended to be a starting point for implementation decisions, focusing on typical authentication methodologies. It is of course not possible to anticipate every possible deployment variation or situation, so the absence of implementation information here should not be interpreted as discouraging any anticipated authentication methods.

These implementation resources should be read alongside SP 800-63B.
