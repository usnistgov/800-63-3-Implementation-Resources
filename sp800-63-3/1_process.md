Risk assessments are formalized processes that aid agencies in identifying, estimating, and prioritizing information security and privacy risks by taking into consideration the threat and vulnerability landscape, with a focus on the magnitude of harm of an adverse event and the likelihood such an event will occur. 

These assessments are important because:
- they reduce uncertainty; 
- they are proactive measures rather than reactive measures; 
- they allow for quicker, more efficient responses to adverse circumstances or events; 
- they increase organizational awareness of potential threats and vulnerabilities; 
- they could lead to cost savings in the event of an adverse circumstance or event; 
- they help safeguard PII, protecting customer privacy; and 
- they instill more confidence in an agency and its customers.  

To mitigate digital identity risks, federal government agencies providing digital identity services must utilize risk assessments – as stated in NIST Special Publication 800-63-3 – to map out risks associated with identity proofing, authentication, and federation.

Agencies may approach the risk assessment process in a way that best suits its mission and needs. However, the following methodology may prove beneficial to agencies seeking guidance on the risk assessment process:
