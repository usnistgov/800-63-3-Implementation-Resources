Identity evidence comprises physical or digital artifacts used by a subscriber to prove the real-world existence of a claimed identity. Evidence required by the agency and provided by the applicant must contain features that support both validation (confirmed to be genuine and accurate) and verification (demonstrated to associated with the subscriber) at the appropriate strengths for a defined use case.

It is ultimately up to the agency to determine which biographic information to collect about an applicant to meet identity resolution needs. Caution should be taken in collecting, utilizing, and storing a minimally required set of attributes. Furthermore, in accordance with requirements in 800-63A, notice must be provided to users about what information is collected, why it is collected, and what will be done with it.

The following table provides examples of evidence from each category of strength defined in the aforementioned identity evidence quality table in 800-63A.

The evidence contains a reference number, full name, and image (photo) for verification. It includes digital information and physical security features which can be validated, such as a watermark, microprint, optically variable ink, and an RFID chip. Many passports also contain a captured biometric which can be used for biometric verification if needed, including an image of the photograph of the passport holder, and fingerprint and iris scan templates.  | Under current criteria, passports could be considered as low as Fair, since they can be issued via the mail. Although passports are capable of storing biometric templates, not all passports have biometric templates on them. However, the recommendation is to consider passports Superior evidence. |
| Permanent Resident Card (Issued On or After May 11, 2010) | Superior | Permanent Resident Cards issued on or after May 11, 2010 are considered Superior evidence because because the issuing source confirmed claimed identity by following U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services green card issuance policies.
